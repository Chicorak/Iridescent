## Contributing to Iridescent
👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

This is a fairly new project, and these guidelines are subject to change as the repository matures.

## How can I Contribute?
There are several ways you can contribute; they are listed below:
* Reporting Bugs
* Suggesting Enhancements
* Adding New Features

## Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin? You can start off by taking a look through the issues; you never know, there just might be the right one for you to help out with :)

## Pull Requests
The process described here has several goals:
* Maintain Iridescent's quality
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Engage the community in working towards the best possible results
* Enable a sustainable system for Iridescent's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1: Follow all instructions in the [pull request template](https://github.com/DevelopingThings/Iridescent/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2: Follow the styleguides
3: After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing if present.

## Styleguide
Git commit messages:
* `Highlight` the key commit message parts with markdown
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

C++
* `CamelCased`: The name starts with a capital letter, and has a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores.
* `Bracket Style`: Follows the _One True Brace Style._
```cpp
int Foo(bool isBar)
{
    if (isFoo) {
        bar();
        return 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}
```
* More will be added later as the project matures :)
